<h4>How to search for a wine</h4>On the left, you can enter the criteria for the wine you are looking for. Some tips:<BR/>			<ul>			<li>Name is a mandatory field. You can enter one or more keywords that describe a wine (at least 3 letters), for instance Almaviva or Vega Sicilia. Parts of your keywords will be matched, so if you are not sure about the spelling, just enter the first part of the word that you are sure of.  			<li>To exclude a keyword, enter -keyword. So Leoville -Poyferre will find L&eacute;oville Las Cases, but not L&eacute;oville Poyferr&eacute;!			<li>You can enter a keyword without accents: Leoville will find both Leoville and L&eacute;oville. 			<li>For vintage, you can use a ranges using '-' or multiple years using ',' ( like 1970-1975, 1982, 1990, 1998-).			</ul>The &#88;ML button allows you to create an &#82;&#83&#83; feed from your search.
