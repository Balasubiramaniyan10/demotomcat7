<h3>About us</h3>
vinopedia is a search engine for wines. It allows you find the best price on a specific wine you are looking for. The use of this service is free. For a list of the most popular searches, click <a href='topsearches.jsp'>here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>How it works</h3>
vinopedia has a web robot that retrieves information on wines from Internet stores that are publically available on the internet. The big difference between a normal search engine like Google and us is that we don't retrieve web pages as a whole. Instead, we interpret the information on the advertised wines and allow you to easily search for a wine. Just type in the name of the wine you are looking for, and you easily find all prices for wines that match your search criteria. Every night, we update the wine list.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Independency</h3>
We are not affiliated to any stores. All wines that match your search are shown, not just wines from sponsoring shops. In principle, anyone selling wine can be indexed by vinopedia. However, our focus is on the European wine market. This is because it is unlikely that you can purchase a wine much cheaper oversees, due to transport costs. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Joining vinopedia</h3>
If you are selling wine in Europe and you are not listed yet, please <a href='contact.jsp'>contact us</a>. In most cases, having your site listed on vinopedia is free. We do require that you list your wines on-line, either by means of a web site or by publishing your price list in Excel format. <br/>
<h3>Sponsoring</h3>
vinopedia is a great medium to direct more people to your web site. You can gain extra attention if you have your wines listed as sponsored links. These will show up before all other results are show and will be the first wines potential customers will see. Besides that, in the results list they are marked with a special color. An example is shown below.<br/><br/>

You only pay if users click on the advertised wines and get directed to your web site. For more information about sponsoring, click <a href='sponsoring.jsp'>here</a>.
