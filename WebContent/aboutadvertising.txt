<h3>Attracting the right customers to your site</h3>
Having your wines listed on Free Wine Searcher is free. But your wines will be among the wines from many other suppliers. We offer 2 ways of standing out of the crowd: sponsored links and banners.
<h3>Sponsored links</h3>
The search results on Free Wine Searcher are sorted on price by default. The cheapest offers are presented on top, which attracts the most attention. Sponsored links allow you the possibility of being listed in the top-5 search results even if your offer is not the cheapest. Besides that, all wines from your shop will be highlighted in the search results so they will attract extra attention. Sponsored links are an excellent way of attracting wine buyers that are looking for the wines you sell.
<h4>How does it work</h4>
Sponsored search results works with a bid system: the highest bidder gets the highest ranking. A maximum of 5 sponsored links are shown, after that the rest of the search results are shown. Even if your bid is not amongst the 5 highest, your wines will still be highlighted in the results for extra attention. You are only charged if a visitor visits your online store by clicking a wine. If a user does not click on your wine, you don't pay anything. Even if the user goes to the next page of results or changes the sort order, your wines will be displayed on top.
<h3>Placing a bid</h3>
A bid can be any amount between &euro; 0,25 and &euro; 10,00. The bid is valid for all wines that your company sells. If you are the highest bidder and you have 3 wines in the search results, all three will be shown on top.
<h3>Banners</h3>
If you want to promote your store and build a reputation, a banner on Free Wine Searcher is the way to go. We offer a unique system for matching advertisements to a target audience. Do you want to target people from a specific country? Not a problem! Do you specialize in wines from a certain country, and do you want to target people looking for wine from that country? Can be done!  
<h4>Per per click</h4>
You only pay per click. If a visitor does not click on your banner, you don't pay anything. Also, you only pay the first click of a visitor per day. 
<h4>Banner pricing</h4>
The price of a banner depends on how well it matches your target audience. The base price of a banner is what you pay for an "untargeted" click. If a visitor is from a country you are targeting, you pay the base price times on-and-a-half (x 1.5). If a visitor does a search for a wine that is from a country you are targeting, you also pay the base price x 1.5. If both the country of the visitor and the country of the wine match, you pay 2 times the base price. You can have different banners for different audiences.
<h3>Reports on advertising campaigns</h3>
When you place banners or are sponsoring links, we provide you with real-time reports on the number of banners shown, the number of links clicked and your account balance. You can drill down the clicked link reports to get more information on who clicked your links (time of click, country of origin and the wine they are searching for). This will help you in determining if you are attracting the right customers. To prevent click fraud, we also show you the first part of the IP-address of the visitor (for privacy reasons, the last number of the address is concealed).
<h3>Engaging in advertisements</h3>
We offer self-service pages where you can place or withdraw a bid and upload or remove banners. From the same place, you can view the real-time reports.
<h3>Payments</h3>
We will charge you per month. If the amount due is lower than &euro 10,00, the amount is transferred to the next month. You will receive an invoice per email. The payment term is 14 days. If we haven't received your payment then, you will receive a reminder. If we still haven't received a payment 14 days after the reminder email, we will remove your banners and wines from Free Wine Searcher. We cannot issue invoices on paper due to the high costs involved.
