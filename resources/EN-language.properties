welcometextsmartsearch=<i>A new search method (under construction...)</i><br/><br/>Here you can experience the new search routine, which is still under development. If you type a wine name on the left, some suggestions will be given as you type (if you have Javascript enabled). By using the mouse or arrow keys, you can select a wine from the list.<br/><br/>Normaly, a search on FreeWineSearcher is in free text. This means that the search is carried out by looking for the keywords you type in the description of the wine. This means a search for "Leoville Las Cases" will also find a wine like "Clos du Marquis, 2nd wine of Chateau Leoville Las Cases", which is probably not what you are looking for. <br/><br/>We are working on a system that recognizes wines and lets you search for a specific wine instead of just for keywords. This will give you more focussed search results. The results are not yet 100%, but we are working on that. Also, if we have ratings of the wine, they are shown on top of the page.<br/><br/>We hope you like the new style of searching!

helptext=<h4>How to search for a wine</h4>On the left, you can enter the criteria for the wine you are looking for. Some tips:<BR/>			<ul>			<li>Name is a mandatory field. You can enter one or more keywords that describe a wine (at least 3 letters), for instance Almaviva or Vega Sicilia. Parts of your keywords will be matched, so if you are not sure about the spelling, just enter the first part of the word that you are sure of.  			<li>To exclude a keyword, enter -keyword. So Leoville&nbsp;-Poyferre will find L&eacute;oville Las Cases, but not L&eacute;oville Poyferr&eacute;!			<li>You can enter a keyword without accents: Leoville will find both Leoville and L&eacute;oville. 			<li>For vintage, you can use a ranges using '-' or multiple years using ',' ( like 1970-1975, 1982, 1990, 1998-).			</ul>The &#88;ML button allows you to create an &#82;&#83&#83; feed from your search. Copy and paste the URL in your favorite feed reader to keep track of your search.<br/>

ratingexplanation=<h4>About ratings:</h4>Several wine professionals publish tasting notes about the wines they taste. Besides this textual description of the wine, its taste, color and nose, they also rate the wine. This is a measure of how much they liked the wine. Of course, taste is a personal and subjective matter. However, you could use the general opinion of these professional tasters as an indication of the quality of the wine.<h4>Vintages</h4>Vintages we recommend because of their price/quality ratio are listed in bold.<h4>The rating scales</h4>All ratings listed are on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the higher the perceived quality of the wine. Although there are differences between the scales used by different reviewers, they more or less follow the following scale (after Robert Parker):<ul><li>96-100: An extraordinary wine of profound and complex character displaying all the attributes expected of a classic wine of its variety. Wines of this caliber are worth a special effort to find, purchase, and consume. There are few wines that actually make it into this top category because there are not many great wines.</li><li>90-95: An outstanding wine of exceptional complexity and character. In short, these are terrific wines.</li><li>80-89: A barely above average to very good wine displaying various degrees of finesse and flavor as well as character with no noticeable flaws. Particularly wines in the 85-89 range offer great value.</li><li>70-79: An average wine with little distinction except that it is a soundly made. In essence, a straightforward, innocuous wine.</li><li>60-69: A below average wine containing noticeable deficiencies, such as excessive acidity and/or tannin, an absence of flavor, or possibly dirty aromas or flavors.</li><li>50-59: A wine deemed to be unacceptable.</li></ul>The minimum score a wine can receive is 50. Now the rating alone does not tell the complete story. For a more profound description of the wine you should have a look at the full tasting notes as published by their reviewers on their web sites or in their books. And to be sure you like it, nothing beats tasting the actual wines before you buy them, if you have the chance!<h4>Sources:</h4><ul><li>Robert Parker: &#169; The Wine Advocate, full reviews available on <a href='http://eRobertParker.com' target='_blank'>eRobertParker.com</a>.
